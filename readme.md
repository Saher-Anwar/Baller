## Technologies

- Unity Hub: 2.4.2
- Unity Engine: 2019.4.16f1
- Visual Studio Community: 2019

## Detailed Introduction
I decided to create this game in the beginning of 2021 to familiarize myself with other parts of the Unity
Engine which I hadn't touched upon much before. Since I had basic knowledge on Unity's physics system and scripting, 
I wanted to create a simple game but add a lot of visual effects to it to familiarize myself with the Unity's particle 
system, post-processing mechanics and the main camera. 

The game itself doesn't require any assets whatsoever. It's built upon basic sprites: circles and squares. The general
idea is that the user uses his mouse and drags to add a velocity to the blue circle (the player). The player bashes 
into other red circles (the enemies) and destroys them thus earning points. The goal of the game is to basically achieve 
the highest score possible.
